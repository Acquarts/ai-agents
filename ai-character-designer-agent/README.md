# Hi, I'm Adrián 👋

I build AI solutions that work in production — from predictive models to conversational agents powered by LLMs.

My focus is on **Applied AI**: turning complex problems into working systems using Machine Learning, RAG pipelines, and agentic architectures. I enjoy the full journey from prototype to deployment.

Check out my work at [azafuture.com](https://www.azafuture.com), where I share projects, experiments, and practical AI implementations.

## What I work on

- 🤖 **AI Agents**: conversational systems, RAG pipelines, LangChain, multi-agent architectures
- 📊 **Data Science**: predictive modeling, demand forecasting, customer segmentation
- 🧠 **Deep Learning**: computer vision (YOLO, ResNet, EfficientNet), neural networks
- 🚀 **MLOps & Deployment**: FastAPI, Docker, AWS, Streamlit, Railway
- 🔄 **Automation**: n8n workflows, intelligent pipelines

## About Me

- 🎯 **Applied AI Engineer** at Aselvia, building conversational agents with Python, RAG, LangChain, FastAPI and vector databases
- 📈 Previously **Data Scientist** at Tiendas MGI — demand forecasting, Power BI dashboards, pricing optimization
- 🎓 **Master's in Applied AI** from Instituto Europeo de Posgrado
- 🛠️ I prototype fast, iterate often, and ship things that solve real problems
- 🎨 Senior 3D Artist background for video games
